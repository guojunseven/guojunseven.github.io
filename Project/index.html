            <p><strong>Description:</strong> I Implemented the web server using Servlet and deployed it through Tomcat on 4 * t2.micro AWS elastic
                computing servers with a network level elastics load balancer. I Improved the throughput of concurrent requests up to 8000 / s through implementing asynchronous message
                queues with RabbitMQ with custom channel pool and using the efficient DynamoDB cluster. I Designed the Backend using serverless processing stream and CQRS pattern which applied AWS lambda streaming service listening to the update events for the dynamo database and processing the text to Aurora
                database for efficient query.</p>

            <p> <strong>Description:</strong> Developed a service called Quality Metrics Unit using Python in the CI phase of Integrated Pipeline with
                DevOps fashion which utilized Logistic Regression for evaluating the code risk based on code features and expertise knowledge for saving 90% manual tests. I was responsible for the entire life cycle of the service including training model, developing RESTful API and evaluation web page for labeling and reviewing.</p>

            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Collected a huge amount of covid-diagnosis data from API provided by Israel Health Department Website. And construct a complete Pipeline
            for Data Understanding, Preprocessing, Feature Engineering, Sampling, Modeling and Evaluation. Utilized and compared several ML models like Random Forest, Neuro Network.
            Explored methods to handle highly imbalanced data to finally get a 90% in AUROC score.</p>
